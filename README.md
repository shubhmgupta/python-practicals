# Practical Questions

1. WAP to find the roots of a quadratic equation with error handling.

2. WAP to accept a number ‘n’ and
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Check if ’n’ is prime</li>
        <li>Generate all prime numbers till ‘n’</li>
        <li>Generate first ‘n’ prime numbers</li>
    </ul>
   This program may be done using functions

3. WAP to create a pyramid of the character ‘*’ and a reverse pyramid

             *
            ***
           *****
          *******
         ********* 

                *********
                 *******
                  *****
                   ***
                    *

4. WAP that accepts a character and performs the following: 
    <ul type='square'>
        <li>print whether the character is a letter or numeric digit or a special character </li>
        <li>if the character is a letter, print whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase</li>
        <li>if the character is a numeric digit, prints its name in text (e.g., if input is 9, output is NINE)</li>
    </ul>
5. WAP to perform the following operations on a string
    <ul type='square'>
        <li>Find the frequency of a character in a string.</li>
        <li>Replace a character by another character in a string. </li>
        <li>Remove the first occurrence of a character from a string. </li>
        <li>Remove all occurrences of a character from a string. </li>
    </ul>
6. WAP to swap the first n characters of two strings.
7. Write a function that accepts two strings and returns the indices of all the occurrences of
the second string in the first string as a list. If the second string is not present in the first
string then it should return -1.
8. WAP to create a list of the cubes of only the even integers appearing in the input list
(may have elements of other types also) using the following:
    <ul type="square">
        <li>'for' loop </li>
        <li>list comprehension</li>
    </ul>
